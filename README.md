# Under-the-Hood

All files included in my Youtube series: [Under the Hood](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8co7d52--VLDIHwpt3SXfw)

## Build Instructions

If you want to build the files yourself, you'll need `CMake` and `Ninja`, along with a `C` compiler.
After you have the required tools, run `make reset` to initialize `CMake`, and check inside the `makefile` to see what run commands there are.
